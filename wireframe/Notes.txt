Api Research:
-Identify the (3) APIs I'll be using (calendar, map, weather)


>>>Calendar Api:
-Google Calendar - https://developers.google.com/calendar


>>>Map Api:
-Google Map - 


>>>Weather Api:
-weatherapi (documentation examples seem clear) - https://www.weatherapi.com/
-forecast API: accuweather (attempted to use previously, only give 5 day results in free mode) - https://developer.accuweather.com/apis
-weatherstack.com


>>>RESEARCH:
-React Native*

TODOs:
X - Convert all packing lists (in the index.js folder in src)

X - Update switch in the ListSelect.jsx

- Hook up weather API (need to add weather type in list context - from destination page to weather page to pack page)

- Add temp avg, rain, snow, sun (calling weather api on weather page and the pack page) - hitting api from 2 pages OR store to context

X - Edit field is not talking to axios, what happens if I go to update my name of a trip to a name that already exists? // NEED TO BE ABLE TO UPDATE USING THE EDIT page

- If you're able to pull AT LEAST TEMP from weather api, then reduce the number of pre-selected packlists (ex: if rainy "FILTER" the lists) - lists.filter... if sunny filter out any that refer to rain, etc.

- WOOT HAVE FUN!

- Register Google APIs 

- Complete CSS at the end

- Save button should navigate to next...

- Consider a update on final page (similar to save componenet)
